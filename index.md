## Computers. math, and science

This site is where I post software and other things that interest me or that I am working on.

If you can use any of my work, feel free to do so.

Typically, when I am trying to learn something, I pick a book and try to code the examples in several different languages. So I might be studying a book on Python for Science and Engineering, I will code the examples and problems in Python, MATLAB, Mathematica, and possibly C#/C++. That way I learn what is presented in the book and the strengths and weaknesses of each language.
