## Computers. math, and science

This site is where I post software and other things that interest me or that I am working on.

If you can use any of my work, feel free to do so.

Typically, when I am trying to learn something, I pick a book and try to code the examples in several different languages. So I might be studying a book on Python for Science and Engineering, I will code the examples and problems in Python, MATLAB, Mathematica, and possibly C#/C++. That way I learn what is presented in the book and the strengths and weaknesses of each language.

In case you haven't figured it out, I'm also trying to Github pages and the markdown framework. So this site will be a little rough for now.

Python - Free to use, lots of libraries for data analysis, graphics, etc. Easy to get up to speed with.

MATLAB - High price, but has personal use license. Fast, precise, graphics are OK. If you know BASIC, this is a quick learn.

C#/C++ - C# has very good integration with MS products and API, easy to develope a Windows app with. Documentation is excellent and Visual Studio is easy to use. C++ allows crossplatform development across Linux and Windows.

Mathematica - Has a pretty steep learning curve, but once you get used to it you will be impressed with what can be done. This blows all others out of the water, graphics, symbolics, numerics, it can't be beat.
